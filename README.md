# EsterGambling for ESP32 (and other Arduino C supported WiFi microcontrollers)
yeah basically [pat's ester gambling project](https://github.com/n1d3v/ester-gambling) but barebones and it runs on a cheapo microcontroller

## Setup
simple as 123s. just download the code, open in your IDE of choice (arduino ide, platformio) and upload it to your microcontroller (with WiFi ofc) of choice

## Usage
get your serial monitor app ready because you will need to enter your WiFi's SSID and password, baud rate is 115200 so make sure is set to that. after that the board will print out the IP you will need to access through a web browser to get to the "GUI"

## Credits
